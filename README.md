# TMOC

<strong>TMOC</strong> (<em>Threat Modelers on Chain</em>) is a tool that combines threat modeling with a blockchain-based collective intelligence system developed as a blockchain-based Web3 in the form of a decentralized web.

Threat modeling is a risk-based approach to designing security systems based on threat identification for threat mitigation. Threat modeling is a "<em>team sport</em>" because it requires the knowledge and skills of different teams, all inputs can be considered of equal value. It is a framework that integrates the threat modeling process on a larger scale through blockchains that enable large-scale collaboration.
